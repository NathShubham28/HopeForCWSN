                    HOPE works for the well-being and development of children 
                    with special needs. It was setup in January 2018 and was 
                    registered under the 'Societies Registration Act' of 1860. 
                    The idea for the organization came up in 2017 when special 
                    educator, Himanshu Pahwa with his colleagues conducted a 
                    survey in Nizamuddin railway line. During the survey, our 
                    special educators came across many children with special 
                    needs who were looked down by the society and were striving 
                    with the lack of awareness, knowledge and unavailability of resources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The aim is to create a positive and healthy atmosphere 
                    for children with special needs where they can rise and 
                    are given equal rights and opportunities to come forth 
                    and face the world independently. Also, it aims at creating 
                    awareness among individuals regarding the myths related to 
                    disability. HOPE made it's first centre of education named 
                    as Mainstream Educational Centre in Malviya Nagar, New Delhi. 
                    Mainstream Educational Centre focuses on over all development 
                    of the child depending on their needs. Mainstream Educational 
                    Centre include children coming from all sections of the society 
                    from the age group of 4-17 years. We also work on their academics 
                    and provide them with certain therapy.
                </p>              

                <p>
                    HOPE deals with special children and work on short 
                    term and long term goals to make them self-reliant. 
                    We, the special educators are specialised in teaching 
                    students with special needs, and counsel their parents. 
                    We focus on comprehending their abilities, strengths and 
                    make them work upon their weaknesses and make them more 
                    confident. Children with special needs have to face prejudice. 
                    So, we work on spreading awareness among people regarding 
                    disability. We spread awareness through signature banners, 
                    distributing pamphlets, doing awareness campaigns in colleges 
                    and performing Nukkad Natak because these are the foremost ways 
                    to connect with public for spreading awareness. Lastly, together 
                    we work to abjure the psychological barriers.

                <p>
                    Special Education is the process of enlightening the 
                    lives of children with special needs (CWSN). It is the 
                    key to their growth and development but sadly, the 
                    Education of children with special needs (CWSN) is 
                    often neglected and looked down on because of their 
                    disabilities which are iniquitous. Education is crucial 
                    for these children with special needs. It helps them to 
                    overpower their disabilities and aids in mental growth. 
                    It builds financially strong and independent individuals. Special 
                    education entails unique techniques for imparting education. The different
                    child perceives things differently and keeping this in mind, 
                    We the Special educators at HOPE children with special needs 
                    NGO monitor each child and impart them education
                    based on individual differences. We cultivate an environment 
                    where they enjoy education. Based on their unique learning needs
                    special educators are assigned. The method and pace of education
                    are kept different for different special children. Through 
                    education, we aim to make children with special needs physically, 
                    mentally, financially, socially, and emotionally independent. We 
                    want them to walk hand in hand with normal children so that they 
                    are not looked down upon. Education is the only way to make them 
                    independent so that, they can live on their terms. We urge society
                    to support their education and help them to live fulfilling lives 
                    enriched with happiness and dreams.

                    The purpose of counseling is to ensure that the children 
                    with special needs and their families have access to appropriate 
                    support and interventions to facilitate their uniqueness and 
                    individuality, improving their physical, emotional and social 
                    capabilities. To do the same Hope for CWSN NGO includes an open 
                    communication where it works to adjure the psychological barriers, 
                    comprehending their abilities, strengths and make them work upon 
                    their weakness so that they can achieve the highest potential in

                    This organization aims to create a positive and healthy 
                    atmosphere for children with special needs where they can 
                    rise and are given equal rights and opportunities to come

                    educators and team at HOPE NGO, continually work on awarding 
                    each being around, and in this whole activity, parents play a 
                    valuable character. This organization aims to provide children 
                    with special needs  independent living skills along with academics. 
                    We work on spreading awareness among people regarding disability. 
                    We spread awareness through signature banners, distributing pamphlets, 
                    doing awareness campaigns in colleges, and performing Nukkad Natak 
                    as these are the foremost ways to connect with the public for spreading 
                    awareness. HOPE, always being an active organization contributed a 
                    lot to the awareness programmes. Our special educators surveyed many 
                    Delhi slums including Nizammudin railway line, Adivasi camps etc. and 
                    succeed in certain awareness drives and many counselling sessions. 
                    Society needs to be aware of the challenges special kid with special 
                    need gets to grips with. Proper knowledge of "what to do" is the foremost
                    step; society and mainly parents are the basic strength these children 
                    ever need in the whole process of transformation into a Confident person. 
                    The change is a must in our society and many-a-times, a little can be the 
                    only thing we needed. HOPE is all about that change and a transformation 
                    of a special child with special needs into an independent, confident 
                    person and a person, our society admires.
